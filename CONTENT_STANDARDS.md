# Content Standards

- Voice and tone: warm, plain language, and steady. Explain jargon on first use and link to `GLOSSARY.md` when helpful.
- Structure: concise intros, clear lab steps with Do/Why/You should see/If it doesn't look right, and explicit success criteria.
- Documentation: keep README, data dictionaries, provenance notes, and validation evidence alongside data. Update them when data changes.
- Accessibility: readable text, described visuals, and low-friction assets. Keep commands copy/paste friendly.
- Consistency: align definitions across days and `learn/` pages (lakes/warehouses/lakehouses, data vaults, schema, provenance/lineage, DOI, licensing).
- Governance: include rights and license information in every shared bundle; avoid sharing sensitive data.
