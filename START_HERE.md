# Start Here

Welcome. This repo is the boxed-up version of a workshop we already ran. Every day is a self-contained 60–90 minute mini-repo, so you can skim, learn, or facilitate without worrying about hidden dependencies.

## Quick 3-click skim
- Click `WORKSHOP_OVERVIEW.md` for the big picture.
- Click `TOOLCHAIN_SETUP.md` to see what access you need.
- Click `day-01-metadata-cleaning-and-normalization/` to preview the flow and artifacts.

## Path for learners
1) Read this page and `TOOLCHAIN_SETUP.md` to confirm you’re ready.  
2) Start with Day 01 for legibility, then jump to the day that fits your immediate need. Each stands alone.  
3) Use the job aids in each `02-job-aids/` when you get stuck, and capture artifacts in `05-artifacts/`.  

## Path for trainers or adopters
1) Skim `WORKSHOP_OVERVIEW.md` and `CONTENT_STANDARDS.md` for tone and structure.  
2) Copy templates from `templates/` for reuse and adapt them for your context.  

## Why this repo is organized this way
Each day lives as a mini-repo with primers, labs, job aids, assessments, diagrams, and an artifacts folder. This keeps things portable: you can run a single session, swap in your own datasets, or drop the whole day into another program. Templates sit at the root so future iterations stay consistent and easy to adopt.
