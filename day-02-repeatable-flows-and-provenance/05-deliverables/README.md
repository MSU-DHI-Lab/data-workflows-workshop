# Deliverables

Use this space to store what you generate in Day 02.

- Flow definition exports from NiFi (often saved as a `.json` file, a structured text format) go here or in `lab-02/deliverables/`.
- Updated `flow_blueprint.md` with final processor properties belongs here too if you want a central copy.
- Run record narratives and any sample input/output files for the performance task can live in `submissions/`.

Keep filenames descriptive (e.g., `flow_definition_2025-12-20.json`, `run_record_note_record1001.md`).
