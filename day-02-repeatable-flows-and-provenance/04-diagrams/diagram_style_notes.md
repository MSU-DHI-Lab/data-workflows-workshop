# Diagram Style Notes

- Left-to-right flow with verbs in each box: pick up, set, make values consistent, check, write.
- Relationships labeled on branches (unmatched vs quarantine) to show routing.
- Run record shown as a shared destination to emphasize tracing both paths.
- We use this diagram to help newcomers see the full path before touching NiFi; it also makes the quarantine step (for review) visible.
