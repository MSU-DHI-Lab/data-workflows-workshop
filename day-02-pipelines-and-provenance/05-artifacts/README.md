# Artifacts

Use this space to store what you generate in Day 02.

- Flow definition exports from NiFi (JSON) go here or in `lab-02/artifacts/`.
- Updated `flow_blueprint.md` with final processor properties belongs here too if you want a central copy.
- Provenance narratives and any sample input/output files for the performance task can live in `submissions/`.

Keep filenames descriptive (e.g., `flow_definition_YYYYMMDD.json`, `provenance_note_record1001.md`).
