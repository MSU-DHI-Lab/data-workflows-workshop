# Diagram Style Notes

- Left-to-right flow with verbs in each box: pick up, set, normalize, check, write.
- Relationships labeled on branches (unmatched vs quarantine) to show routing.
- Provenance shown as a shared destination to emphasize tracing both paths.
- We use this diagram to help newcomers see the full path before touching NiFi; it also makes the governance (quarantine) step visible.
