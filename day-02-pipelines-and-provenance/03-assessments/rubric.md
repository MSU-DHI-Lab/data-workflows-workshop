# Rubric

| Criterion | Emerging | Proficient | Strong |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flow design | Processors missing or unclear | Minimal inbox→normalize→outbox with quarantine built | Flow is minimal, explainable, and connections labeled clearly |
| Provenance use | Little/no provenance review | Provenance trace captured for one record | Provenance narrative clear, linked to governance decisions |
| Quarantine habit | No quarantine route | Quarantine path exists but lightly documented | Quarantine rules clear, documented, and paired with review guidance |
| Reproducibility | No flow export or settings | Flow definition exported; key settings noted | Flow definition plus detailed settings and rationale captured |
| Stakeholder clarity | Steps not explainable | Each processor has a one-sentence purpose | Flow could be presented to non-technical stakeholders confidently |
