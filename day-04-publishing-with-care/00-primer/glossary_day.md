# Day 04 Glossary

- **Publishing with care**: practices that keep data safe, explainable, and respectful when sharing. This includes clear documentation, proper licensing, and thinking about who might use the data.
- **Dataset package**: a folder containing everything someone needs to reuse your data: the data files, README, data dictionary, provenance notes, validation report, and licensing information.
- **DOI (Digital Object Identifier)**: a permanent link that always points to your dataset, even if it moves to a new server. DOIs make citation and versioning clear. Example: `10.5281/zenodo.1234567`
- **Versioning**: assigning numbered releases (like 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 2.0.0) so everyone knows which version they are using. When you make changes, you create a new version.
- **LICENSE**: a document that states what others can and cannot do with your data. Common choices include CC BY 4.0 (share with credit) and CC0 (public domain, no restrictions).
- **CITATION.cff**: a file that tells people and tools how to cite your work. It uses YAML format (a human-readable text format for structured data).
- **Zenodo metadata (.zenodo.json)**: a file using JSON format (a structured text format) that tells Zenodo how to set up your deposit page. It includes title, description, authors, and license information.
- **Practice path**: preparing your dataset package locally without uploading to Zenodo. This lets you practice without creating a real deposit.
- **Live path**: actually uploading to Zenodo and getting a DOI. This creates a permanent, citable record of your dataset.
