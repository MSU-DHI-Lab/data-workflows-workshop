# Quick Reference

## Publishing artifacts and why
- README: context, provenance, safe reuse guidance.
- Data dictionary: field meanings; prevents misinterpretation.
- LICENSE: permissions and restrictions; reduces ambiguity.
- CITATION.cff: how to cite and what version; honors contributors.
- .zenodo.json: structured metadata for DOI landing page.
- Validation/quality report: evidence of checks.

## Practice vs live
- Practice: bundle everything locally; no accounts needed.
- Live: deposit in Zenodo, mint DOI, and record it in README and CITATION.cff.

## Streamlit handoff
- Purpose: give stakeholders a simple view of data + quality status without code.
- Keep minimal: filters, counts, and a quality status section.
