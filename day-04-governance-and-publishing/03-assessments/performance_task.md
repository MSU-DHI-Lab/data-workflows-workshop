# Performance Task

## Scenario
You need to publish a cleaned dataset so partners can cite and reuse it responsibly.

## Your task
1) Assemble the data package (data, README, data dictionary, provenance, checks).
2) Add LICENSE, CITATION.cff, and .zenodo.json with accurate metadata.
3) Complete the publishing checklist and choose practice or live path.
4) If live, deposit to Zenodo and record the DOI in README and CITATION.cff.
5) (Optional) Run the Streamlit handoff and include a screenshot or note for stakeholders.

## Submission
- Place your package zip (or folder), metadata files, and checklist in `05-artifacts/submissions/`.
- If you minted a DOI, include the link. If not, note “practice path”.
