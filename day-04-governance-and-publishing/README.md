# Day 04: Governance and Publishing

Welcome. This final mini-repo focuses on packaging your work so others can reuse it safely. We will assemble publishing artifacts, prepare Zenodo metadata, and optionally stand up a tiny Streamlit handoff view. This is the same flow we ran live, kept honest and lightweight.

## Why governance is care
Governance is about stewarding context so nothing important is lost. Publishing is different from sharing: it adds clear rights, provenance, and a stable reference (DOI) so people can cite and build on your work without guessing.

## Why publishing artifacts matter
Each artifact carries a piece of the trust story:
- README: what this is, where it came from, how to use it safely.
- Data dictionary: what each field means so meaning doesn’t drift.
- LICENSE: how others may reuse the work.
- CITATION.cff: how to credit the creators and version.
- Zenodo metadata: the structured record that powers the DOI landing page.

## What you'll do and produce
- Build a publishable data package with data, docs, and checks in one folder.
- Draft licensing, citation, and Zenodo metadata (practice path requires no account).
- Optionally deploy a simple Streamlit handoff app for stakeholders.

## Timebox
- Lab 01 (package the dataset): ~20 minutes
- Lab 02 (licensing + citation + Zenodo metadata): ~30 minutes
- Lab 03 (optional Streamlit handoff): ~20 minutes

## Two paths
- **Practice path:** prepare all artifacts locally without depositing anywhere. No accounts required.
- **Live path:** if you have a Zenodo account, deposit, mint a DOI, and record it in the package.
