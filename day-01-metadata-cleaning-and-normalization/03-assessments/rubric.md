# Rubric

| Criterion | Emerging | Proficient | Strong |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cleaning targets | Lists issues without using facets | Targets come from facet findings; scope is realistic | Targets are facet-driven and prioritize impact with brief rationale |
| Rights and place normalization | Partial normalization; new variants introduced | Rights collapse to allowed list; places consistent; no invented values | Normalization is consistent, documented, and preserves meaning; explains why choices were made |
| Creator handling | Over- or under-normalizes names | Light formatting applied; avoids risky merges | Thoughtful minimal changes with notes on what was left untouched and why |
| Reproducibility | No operations JSON or incomplete | Operations JSON exported and usable | JSON is clean, labeled, and accompanies a note on how to replay it |
| Validation | No checks run | Basic counts and distinct-value checks completed | Validation summary captured and shared with context for downstream teams |
| Documentation | Missing or minimal | Dataset README and data dictionary started | README and dictionary clearly describe fields, provenance, and decisions |
