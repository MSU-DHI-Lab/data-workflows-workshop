# Performance Task

## Scenario
You received a new batch of metadata from a partner institution. Rights statements and place names are inconsistent, and you need to prep the file for a colleague who will build a discovery interface.

## Your task
1) Import the partner CSV into OpenRefine and facet rights, place, and creator columns.
2) Define three cleaning targets based on the facets.
3) Normalize rights to a clearly stated allowed list; normalize place names to a consistent city/state; lightly standardize creator formatting without guessing identities.
4) Export both the cleaned CSV and the OpenRefine operations file.
5) Run the Colab validation notebook on the cleaned CSV and capture the summary.
6) Write a short note explaining why you made each consistency choice.

## Submission
- Place your cleaned CSV, OpenRefine operations file, and validation summary in `05-artifacts/submissions/`.
- Include a brief README that describes your cleaning targets and why you stopped where you did.
