# Day 01 Glossary

- **Facet**: a quick filter in OpenRefine that groups values so you can see patterns and outliers.
- **Cluster**: an OpenRefine suggestion that similar strings might mean the same thing; you choose what to merge.
- **Normalization**: making values consistent in format and spelling while keeping meaning intact.
- **Controlled vocabulary**: a predefined list of terms approved for use (e.g., rights statements list).
- **Identifier**: a stable label that uniquely points to a record or entity.
- **OpenRefine operations file**: the exported recipe of every transformation you applied in OpenRefine (often saved as `openrefine_operations.json`, a `.json` file meaning a structured text format).
- **Validation**: checks that confirm the cleaned data meets expectations (counts, allowed values, missing fields).
