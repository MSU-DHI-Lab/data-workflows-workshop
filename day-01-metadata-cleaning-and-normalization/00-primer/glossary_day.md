# Day 01 Glossary

- **Facet**: a quick filter in OpenRefine that groups values so you can see patterns and outliers. Think of it like sorting a drawer to see what you have before deciding what to organize.
- **Cluster**: an OpenRefine feature that suggests similar strings might mean the same thing (like "New York" and "new york"). You choose whether to merge them or not.
- **Normalization**: making values consistent in format and spelling while keeping meaning intact. For example, changing "CC-BY-4.0", "cc by 4.0", and "CC BY 4.0" all to "CC BY 4.0".
- **Controlled vocabulary**: a predefined list of approved terms. For example, a list of exactly three allowed rights statements. Using controlled vocabularies prevents endless variations.
- **Identifier**: a stable label that uniquely points to a record or entity. Good identifiers do not change and are not reused.
- **Operations file**: the exported recipe of every transformation you applied in OpenRefine. It is saved as a JSON file (a structured text format) that others can replay on their own data.
- **Validation**: checks that confirm the cleaned data meets expectations (correct counts, allowed values, no missing required fields). Validation catches problems before they spread.
