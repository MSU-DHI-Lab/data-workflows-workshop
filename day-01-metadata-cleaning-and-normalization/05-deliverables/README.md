# Deliverables

Use this folder to store what you produced during Day 01.

- Place cleaned CSV exports here if you want a single drop zone.
- Save your OpenRefine operations file here or in `lab-02/deliverables/` so others can replay your steps.
- Drop validation summaries and small notes that explain what changed and why.
- Submissions for the performance task go in `submissions/`.

Keep filenames descriptive (e.g., `collection_cleaned_2025-12-20.csv`) and include a short note about the source and any remaining quirks.
