# Rubric

| Criterion | Emerging | Proficient | Strong |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Checks selected | Few or misaligned with risks | 6–10 checks mapped to observed risks | Checks prioritized by impact with clear rationale |
| Pandera rules | Errors or unclear rules | Rules run; checks readable | Rules are clean and clearly explain why each check exists |
| Validation execution | Partial runs; no lazy collection | Validates clean and bad data; uses `lazy=True` | Captures full failure set and interprets meaning |
| Reporting | Minimal output, not shared | Markdown report with counts and sample failures | Report plus next actions for colleagues, plain-language summary |
| Reuse/readiness | No saved rules | Rules saved in artifacts | Rules saved, versioned, and documented for repeatable runs |
