# Diagram Style Notes

- Left-to-right flow shows the quality-check steps: profile → rules → validate → report → output.
- Verbs in boxes keep actions clear for non-coders.
- The report node is explicit to remind us that evidence is an artifact, not only console output.
- Use this diagram to orient colleagues before running the notebook.
