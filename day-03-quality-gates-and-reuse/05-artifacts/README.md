# Artifacts

Use this folder to store Day 03 outputs.

- Pandera schema files (`validation_schema.py`) for reuse in pipelines.
- Validation reports (markdown) showing pass/fail summaries and sample failures.
- Notes tying each check to the risk it prevents.
- Submissions for the performance task belong in `submissions/` alongside input/output samples.

Keep filenames descriptive (e.g., `validation_report_YYYYMMDD.md`, `schema_v1.py`).
