# Deliverables

Use this folder to store Day 03 outputs.

- Pandera validation rules files (`validation_schema.py`) for repeatable runs.
- Validation reports (markdown) showing pass/fail summaries and sample failures.
- Notes tying each check to the risk it prevents.
- Submissions for the performance task belong in `submissions/` alongside input/output samples.

Keep filenames descriptive (e.g., `validation_report_2025-12-20.md`, `rules_v1.py`).
